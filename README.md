Chrome exstension that saves you time by not having to look for links on a web page rather delivers you to where you need to be by entering a key word. Works on multi layered pages so will redirect you until user is at the final page related to their input.

For example if you needed your direct deposit form from yuor mobile banking, one would type direct deposit in the exstension and hit go. The exstension would then go ahead and redirect the user to their direct deposit form or most similar result availble. 

Main purpose is to reduce call centre calls which are based around tasks that can be done by individuals without the call centre however they don't know how to.
